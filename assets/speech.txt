It's like tetris reverted.
Here you see your projects code blocks in the bottom. Your boss wants you to implement
features wich usually don't fit well in your project. So you start modifying code blocks here
and there all over the project. Sometimes this process leads to sucessful refactoring, wich allows you to remove
unnecessary code from project.
You should always seek for minimalism in your project, because less code is easier to modify
and allows you to implement new features faster.
Now try to move code blocks with arrow keys. When you're ready to implement incoming feature, hit space.
Keep an eye on deadline! If you fail to implement all features till deadline, your boss will fire you.
And don't slack! Your boss is watching you to ensure you don't spend work time to play minesweeper or tetris!
